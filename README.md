# adiff

An implementation of associative patch composition.

## Theory

There are two interesting ideas here: one, all data is a patch, and you
should be able to treat a patch just like the data it operates on. The first
is stolen straight out of Google Wave [1] (except simpler), and I'm pretty sure the Wave team
didn't invent it either. The second works out to saying that patch application
should be associative, which I haven't seen put in quite this way before.

For now, I represent patches as simple lists of tokens, symbols mostly in this
implementation, of which only two are special, I and D. For example:

    [a b c d] * [] = [a b c d]

where * is patch composition. The I token/thingy copies, or "reads" a symbol
from the RHS into the output.

    [a b I c d] * [x] = [a b x c d]

The number of "reads" in the patch must be balanced with the number of
"writes" in the input. We will soon have to develop concepts of the "write"
and "read" dimensions of a patch.

The D token deletes or skips elements from the input.

    [x y D I] * [a b] = [x y b]

D reads a token from the input but does not write to the output; it has a read
dimension of 1 and a write dimension of 0. We can say that I has write and
read dimensions of 1, and anything else has a read dimension of 0 and write
dimension of 1. A full patch's write and read dimensions are the sum of the
write and read dimensions of its elements. Any two patches where the left
patch's read dimension matches the left patch's write dimension can be composed.

There is one other trick to make these patches associative. My first idea was
that the left patch would simply be a template for the output, but this does
not quite work. Naively,

    [x I D]*([D I I]*[a b c]) = [x I D]*[b c] = [x b]
    ([x I D]*[D I I])*[a b c] = [x I]*[a b c] = DNE

The trick is to carry D's in the right patch into the output. This make sure
that the whatever it would have deleted if we had composed from right to left
still gets deleted. Also, D*I = D for similar reasons: the D needs to delete
whatever the I would have kept if it had been evaluated first. And I*D is
obviously D, too.

So that's about 3 days worth of obsessing over the problem. In the following
semi-formal definition, I'll write arbitrary sequences of symbols within
patches in as <...>, and attach them their dimension, like <a b D D>:2,2
and <...>:a,b . Also, assume y is any non-special symbol, neither I nor D.

    <y <...>:a,b> * < <...>:b,c> =  <y <...>:a,b * <...>:b,c>
    <D <...>:a,b> * <y <...>:b,c> = < <...>a,b * <...>b,c>
    <D <...>:a,b> * <I <...>:b,c> = < <...>a,b * <...>b,c>
    < <...>:a,b>   * <D <...>:b,c> = <D <...>a,b * <...>b,c>
    <I <...>:a,b> * <y <...>:b,c> = <y <...>a,b * <...>b,c>
    <I <...>:a,b> * <D <...>:b,c> = <D <...>a,b * <...>b,c>
    <I <...>:a,b> * <I <...>:b,c> = <I <...>a,b * <...>b,c>

This can be shown to be associative as long as the compositions of the rest
of the streams are also associative. The compose two lists of compatible
dimension, simply compose their contents by the above algorithm. 

If one was patching text, each character would be a token, and each D and I
would skip or retain a single character. One would obviously want to use
some kind of run-length encoding to make this more eficient.

I haven't done the math or implemented it yet, but I belive this should
generalize fairly smoothly to nested lists, which make an expressive data
model (i.e, s-expressions).

## Usage

Just call the adiff.core.compose function with two lists or vectors or what have you, anything that supports (first) and (rest), of compatible sizes, like (compose '(a b D I) '(x y)). It will raise UnsupportedOperationException if the patches are incompatible.
